This is my first project. This is a small clone of Minecraft (build only). Project was made using Three.js lib, and hardest part was create a global light (it was made using glsl shader and calculating "light value" for every vertex on cube). 


Thus it turned out to simulate global illumination (shadow in the corners (1)) and all global light (2):

It's dynamic, so if we delete cube we will see light at the tunel:

Also I implemented block light (for example lava):

Created a dynamic changes of geometry for liquid blocks

And also this Minecraft "physics" of water

 It also works in reverse. So if I remove the very first block of water from which it spread, all the remaining water will "dry up":

This is a digital version of a board game that I came up with when my friends and I got tired of playing Monopoly. Unfortunately multiplayer is not available yet as Heroku has blocked free plans. Here is a link for tutorial how to play.
